# Yidm V3

An attempt to reverse engineer an Android React Native APP.

While in theory you could inject your own JS code and debug it dynamically, this is almost entirely static analysis.

## usage

Install this package by `yarn add @kohaku/yidm-v3` and use it to construct params in request sent to yidm.

It is now possible to construct device id randomly from strings.
